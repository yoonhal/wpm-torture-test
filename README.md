# WPM Torture Test
Learn how to type faster using our _**very**_ human design!

Introducing a device that employs a touch of negative reinforcement to accelerate your typing prowess! A _Gentle_ reminder, delivered through a specially modified Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) device, awaits those who type below optimal speeds. Embrace the mild discomfort and let it propel you towards lightning-fast typing or be prepared for a mild shock of consequences...

### A One-Day, Hackathon Inspired Project
While thinking of interesting ways to pass our time during our short winter break, we decided to tackle a project we could finish within 24 hours - a similar time frame to shorter hackathons. We learned tons about web automation, web scraping, network socket, and UART while brushing up on old skills like coding in Python, coding in C/C++, simple circuit design, and applications of general engineering principles.

While thinking of exciting ways to make the most of our short winter break, we set our sights on a challenge that could be conquered within a 24-hour window â€“ akin to the brevity of hackathons. Along this quick journey, we delved into the realms of web automation, web scraping, network sockets, and UART. All while dusting off familiar skills such as Python coding, C/C++ programming, basic circuit design, and the application of fundamental engineering principles.
